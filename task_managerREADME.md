# Task Manager
Task 25 - This task manager is for a small company that has to register tasks for various users to complete. The task manager program can only be accessed by users in the system and only the admin user can add new users.
The tasks can be edited and have due dates. Printing out statistics allows to see how many tasks are completed, how many are overdue etc.
The generate reports function means that the information for users is written to two new files and the statistics are shown there appropriately.
The system stores the information after it has been closed so the tasks and users that are added, will be kept for the next time the program is run.
